# How to install:

TLDR run the following:
./mvnw generate-resources
if it returns errors, contact Doru

./npm install @angular/cli
again:
./mvnw generate-resources

for more info:
https://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-angular

# How to run:
1. run backend from intellij (should be configured, just press the green arrow at the top right)
2. then run:
./ng build --watch
that command will build the angular app continuously

# Stuff to keep in mind:
1.the frontend and backend run on the same port (localhost:8080)
to diferentiate between the 2, the backend api URL start with "devapi"

2. reloading the page in the angular app while on another URL other than "localhost:8080/"
will not work because the request will go to the backend and not to the frontend app.


# Folders for angular build output:

"target/classes/static" - angular app will be
updated while the spring app is running

"src/main/resources/static" - angular will be updated
once spring app is rerun

# commands:
generate new component:
 ./ng generate component <servicename>

First make sure that the application is running.

1. download bootstrap from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/
2. install bootstrap using the command "npm install bootstrap" in the terminal

We will work in JASMAbackend/src/app. Each directory contains at least
4 files (html, css, ts and spec).

In order to be able to edit the appearance of a page, work will be done in the html file.
The components are found in the file "[file].components.ts"

To add a new component to the application navigate to: app.module.ts and app-routing.module.ts
and add it there.

We use the standard java coding style.

After implementing something, create a new branch and make a pull request there, not via the main branch.

Wait until you receive at least one review to merge.

For questions and problems contact Hex. <3

Not working:

1. Displaying the profile picture in the list of friends
2. Editing the description is not persistent
3. The number of comments does not change
4. Remove friends button on the friends list page
5. The list of friends is not a pop-up, it is a separate page
