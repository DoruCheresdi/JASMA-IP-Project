# How to install:

TLDR run the following:
./mvnw generate-resources
if it returns errors, contact Doru

./npm install @angular/cli
again:
./mvnw generate-resources

# How to run:
1. run backend from intellij (should be configured, just press the green arrow at the top right)
2. then run:
./ng build --watch
that command will build the angular app continuously

# Stuff to keep in mind:
1.the frontend and backend run on the same port (localhost:8080)
to diferentiate between the 2, the backend api URL start with "devapi"

2. reloading the page in the angular app while on another URL other than "localhost:8080/"
will not work because the request will go to the backend and not to the frontend app.


# Folders for angular build output:

"target/classes/static" - angular app will be
updated while the spring app is running

"src/main/resources/static" - angular will be updated
once spring app is rerun

# commands:
generate new component:
 ./ng generate component <servicename>
